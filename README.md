# IOTProject
TSP IoT Research Project as outlined by topic paper.

# PCAP Manipulation
Contains script and .py files for conversion of .pcap files into sessions by MAC address and their subsequent data preprocessing into either image (png) or CSV file format to be used in a neural network one class SVM classifier.

# TLDomainAdaptation
A python implementation of the transfer learning protocol outlined in paper (number later) applied to MNIST datasets. This will be adapted to our network traffic images as well as network traffic CSV files to explore their success to a baseline.

# 'TL_Barkhuizen'
An iterative report on the current state of the art of transfer learning, methods for its application and some use cases.

7/08/20: Results from applying transfer learning alongside a one class SVM classifier on image and CSV dataset to be added.

# Research Papers
Contains all research papers used in this project. Topics covered include transfer learning, traffic representations and anomaly detection. In the future there will be more papers on anomaly detection as it is unexplored for the moment.
